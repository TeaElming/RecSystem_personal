# Recommendation System


## Goals
### E-level
- Build a recommendation system that can find similar users and find recommendations for a user, using the movies large dataset.
- Use Euclidean distance as the similarity measure.
- Implement the system using a REST web service where:
  - client sends a request to a server
  - the server responds with json data
  - the json data is decoded and presented in a client GUI
### C-level
- Implement the Pearson Correlation similarity measure.
- It shall be possible to select which measure to use from the client GUI.
### A-level
- Implement functionality for pre-generating an Item-Based Collaborative Filtering table by transforming the original data set.
- Use the pre-generated table to implement a second way of finding recommendations for a user.
- Only use Euclidean distance as the similarity measure.
- It shall be possible to select how to find recommendations from the client GUI (Item-Based or User-Based).
